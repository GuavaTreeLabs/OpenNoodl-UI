# OpenNoodl-UI

**OpenNoodl-UI** is a project dedicated to recreating and improving the OpenNoodl User Interface using OpenNoodl itself. This innovative approach leverages OpenNoodl's own low-code capabilities to build its user interface, ensuring a self-reliant, modular, and scalable design.

By using OpenNoodl to build OpenNoodl, this project aims to showcase the full potential of the framework while creating a modern, intuitive, and feature-rich user experience.
